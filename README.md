This is my NixOS personal config.
It is still a mess, but I'm still learning nix.

# Main programs:

- hyprland
- waybar
- rofi
- neovim
- tmux
- kitty

# Todo:

- [ ] Change waybar for AGS to improve the top panel.
- [ ] Prepare some shells for legacy nodejs version projects.
- [ ] Fix cursor before running any program.
- [ ] Fix obsidian gpu problem.
